Hello all!

I have chosen number 2 assignment of crawling popular websites and create a database for it.

Firstly I have used BeautifulSoup to crawl the websites. (images.py)
Secondly for creating the database, I have used MySql using PhpMyAdmin. (celebrities1.sql)
I had very little knowledge about the databases, so I did what I could. 
But if given opportunity, I'll learn whatever is needed for the internship.



Thank you.
Rutvik Mendjoge.
